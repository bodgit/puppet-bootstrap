Standalone Puppet manifest to bootstrap a passenger-based puppetmaster on RHEL
and equivalents. Currently assumes puppetmaster has never been installed and
the puppetmaster is to be referred to as puppet.$domain.

$ git clone git://github.com/bodgit/puppet-bootstrap.git
$ puppet --modulepath . -e 'include puppet-bootstrap'
